                      	     Instruction Manual


The compile command has to be issued with ctail.c being in the same directory as the terminal. And all
the other commands have to issued with the terminal being in the same directory as the compiled ctail.  
Before this program can run it must be compiled into an executable file. Using the Linux virtual machine, the below command should compile the program
	gcc ctail.c -o ctail
NAME          
       ctail - output the last part of files
SYNOPSIS          
       ./ctail [file]…[option]…


DESCRIPTION         
	
	Print the last 200 chars of each FILE to standard output. With no FILE given output to standard output 200 chars from logfile.txt.

	There are 4 optional arguments that can be provided which are file path, -n and -L

./ctail is the initial command needed to call the    program. If just this command is called then it will print 200 chars from logfile.txt
	Example: ./ctail

	-n [+int]
	This prints the last [+int] chars from the file logfile.txt. After -n the next argument must be a positive integer.
	Example: ./ctail -n 20 
	This command will print last 20 characters from logfile.txt

File path
	This prints the last 200 chars from [File path] instead of logfile.txt. The file path needs to be specified right after ./ctail.
	Example: ./ctail test.txt
	This command will print the last 200 chars from test.txt

Both -n and file path can be used together to print [+int] chars from file path
	Example: ./ctail test.txt -n 20
	This command will print the last 20 chars from test.txt

-L
	This turns the program into line mode where it prints lines instead of chars. This argument must be provided right after ./ctail. And it prints the last 10 lines from logfile.txt
	Example: ./ctail -L
	This command will print the last 10 lines from logfile.txt

-L can be combined with the previous commands to print lines from file path and print n number of files.
	Example: ./ctail test.txt -L
	This command will print the last 10 lines from test.txt
	Example: ./ctail -L -n 20
	This command will print the last 20 lines from logfile.txt
	Example: ./ctail test.txt -L -n 20
	This command will print the last 20 lines from test.txt

If the -L argument is provided, and the file doesn’t have as many lines as the program is trying to print it will print the whole file.


The inputs must be provided in the above-mentioned format. If the input isn’t structured in that way the program will default into seagmentation error. And if the input file doesn’t exist then the file will say “File doesn’t exist”.

Assumptions: The code considers '\0' part of the given chars or lines
